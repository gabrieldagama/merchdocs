_Recent Orders_

_Recent Orders_ lists your order information as received from Amazon, including:

- Purchase Date
- Order Number
- Status
- Buyer's Name
- Grand Total

You can also narrow your order list using the _Filter by_ options:

- Purchase Date (range)
- Buyer Name
- Total (range)
- Status

The _Recent Orders_ table does not update with Magento order information, even when order import is enabled in Order Settings.

## With Order Import Enabled

After [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}), [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) is `Enabled` by default. This means that corresponding Magento orders are created for your Amazon orders and can be managed in the [Magento Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workflow.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
Regardless of your order import settings, Amazon orders that existed in your Amazon Seller Central account prior to your [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) do not import.

New orders created in Amazon will import into Magento, but not immediately. Amazon assigns a `Pending` status to new orders. After Amazon verifies the order and the payment method, the order status is changed to `Unshipped`. This status change by Amazon triggers the order import into Magento. When imported, the order information appears in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard, and Magento creates a corresponding order.

Imported Amazon orders are managed in the [Magento Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workflow, just like your other Magento stores. Click the Amazon order number in the _Order Number_ column to open the order in the [Magento order process]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}#order-view-descriptions).

### Order Creation Blockers

There are a few scenarios that prevent the corresponding Magento order from creating. Magento orders are not created for orders that are received when any of the following issues occur.

- The item does not exist in the Magento catalog.

  Solution: [Create the new product]({% link sales-channels/asc/creating-assigning-catalog-products.md %}) in your Magento catalog and [manually match]({% link sales-channels/asc/creating-assigning-catalog-products.md %}) it to the product.

- The item in the catalog is disabled.

   Solution: Make sure the [product status]({% link catalog/inventory-product-stock-options.md %}) is enabled.

- The ordered item is out of stock.

   Solution: Update or configure the [product options]({% link catalog/inventory-product-stock-options.md %}) for quantity and source.

When the issue is resolved, the Magento order is created on the next sync.

## With Order Import Disabled

If you do not want to import and manage your your Amazon orders in Magento, you can change the [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) setting to `Disabled`. This means that when new orders are received from Amazon, corresponding Magento orders are created.

When disabled, order information received from Amazon appears in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard. This order information is view only, and you must manage these orders in Amazon Seller Central. Click the Amazon order number in the _Order Number_ column to open the order details in Amazon Seller Central.
